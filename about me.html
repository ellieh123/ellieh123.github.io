 <font size="5"> Hi guys! As you already know I'm a chocolate lab named Sadie. I am currently eight years old but will be nine in a few weeks! I live with my loving family of five in a a town located in Eastern Maine, where the ground is typically covered with snow! Lots of mainers hate it, but the fluffy white coldness feels soothing underneath my paws! Not to mention it's fun to eat!
<p> I have three siblings, all of whom are humans. I am the only pet in the house and I love it! I get all the attention to myself! Frequently my friend Abby will visit (she's a cockapoo- see last photo) and we have the best times chasing each other around the yard. The backyard is my favorite place to be other than my bed! I go swimming out there, play fetch with my soccer ball, and it's also my bathroom! </p>
